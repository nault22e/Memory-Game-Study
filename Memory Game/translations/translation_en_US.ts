            <source>In this game, I will ask you to touch my body parts in a certain order with your weaker hand.  The four body parts I will use are my head, left hand, right hand, and foot.  If you would prefer, you can touch my foot by tapping it lightly with your toe.  The amount of actions I will ask you to remember will vary with each round.  You will have five lives, which will be displayed on my screen.  When you are out of lives, the game will end. Touch my hand to start the game, or touch my foot to quit.</source>
