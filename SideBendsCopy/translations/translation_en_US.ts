            <source>Bend to the side with control, stand upright, pause, and bend to the other side.  If you decide to stand,  keep your feet shoulder width apart, heels down, and weight even through both feet.  Also remember to bend your knees slightly. Your hips and legs should remain still. Use light support of a chair for confidence if needed. If you are seated, keep your buttocks in contact with the chair as you bend. Touch my hand to begin.</source>
